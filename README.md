# speaker-verification-system-\
This project implements a Speaker Verification System using deep learning and audio feature extraction. It leverages MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) for feature representation and a trained neural network for identifying speakers with high confidence. The system is capable of verifying speakers in real-time from audio recordings, making it suitable for applications in authentication and personalized voice interactions. ​​
